# Welcome

Welcome to **The Relative and Absolute Encyclopedia of Autism**.

## About This Wiki

This encyclopedia provides comprehensive information about Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).

Autism is like a "cough." Just as a cough can be caused by various conditions—a cold, influenza, asthma, allergies—autism also has diverse underlying causes. In other words, autism is a **symptom**, not a disease itself.

Understanding of autism's causes has evolved significantly. Until the mid-1990s, environmental factors were considered primary. Subsequently, the focus shifted to genetic and congenital factors. Today, researchers recognize that autism likely results from a combination of multiple factors—including genetic predisposition, prenatal environmental influences, and postnatal environmental factors.

Therefore, approaches to intervention, management, and treatment must also be tailored to these diverse underlying causes. This requires systematic categorization.

This site aims to categorize the causes of autism and continuously update the latest research papers and findings, providing information to a broad audience ranging from the general public to medical professionals.
