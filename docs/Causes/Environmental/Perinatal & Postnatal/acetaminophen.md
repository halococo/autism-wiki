# Acetaminophen

*Also known as Paracetamol, Tylenol*

## Overview

Acetaminophen (paracetamol) is one of the most widely used over-the-counter pain relievers and fever reducers. Recent research has investigated potential associations between prenatal and early postnatal acetaminophen exposure and autism spectrum disorder.

## Background

- **Common uses**: Pain relief, fever reduction
- **Availability**: Over-the-counter medication
- **Prevalence**: Used by approximately 50% of pregnant women worldwide
- **Safety profile**: Generally considered safe when used as directed

## 2025 FDA Action

### FDA Label Change (September 22, 2025)

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration initiated a label change process for acetaminophen to reflect evidence suggesting that use by pregnant women may be associated with increased risk of neurological conditions such as autism and ADHD in children.

**Key Points from FDA Announcement:**
- FDA issued a physician notice alerting doctors nationwide
- Evidence from multiple large-scale cohort studies, including the Nurses' Health Study II and Boston Birth Cohort, shows associations between prenatal exposure and later autism/ADHD diagnoses
- Risk may be most pronounced with chronic use throughout pregnancy
- FDA Commissioner emphasized that "even with this body of evidence, the choice still belongs with parents"

### Important Caveats

The FDA explicitly stated: "while an association between acetaminophen and neurological conditions has been described in many studies, a causal relationship has not been established and there are contrary studies in the scientific literature."

Acetaminophen remains the only over-the-counter drug approved for treating fevers during pregnancy, and high fevers in pregnant women can pose risks to their children. Additionally, aspirin and ibuprofen have well-documented adverse impacts on the fetus.

## Research on Autism Connection

### Supporting Evidence

Studies suggesting associations include:
- Large-scale cohort studies (Nurses' Health Study II, Boston Birth Cohort) reporting associations between in utero exposure and later diagnoses of ASD and ADHD
- Dose-dependent relationships observed in some research
- Timing sensitivity: exposure during specific trimesters may have different effects

### Conflicting Evidence

Recent sibling-controlled studies from Sweden (Ahlqvist 2024) and Norway (Gustavson 2021) that adequately addressed genetic confounding and familial factors found no significant association between prenatal acetaminophen and neurodevelopmental outcomes once these confounders were considered.

A February 2025 review of high-quality studies concluded that "in utero exposure to acetaminophen is unlikely to confer a clinically important increased risk" of autism.

### Scientific Community Response

The World Health Organization (WHO) stated on September 24, 2025: "there is currently no conclusive scientific evidence confirming a possible link between autism and use of acetaminophen during pregnancy."

Dr. Zeyan Liew from Yale School of Public Health, a leading researcher on this topic, stated: "We do not know yet for sure whether acetaminophen causes autism" and emphasized that "it is premature to declare we know for sure what is causing autism."

## Proposed Mechanisms

### Oxidative Stress
- Acetaminophen metabolism depleting glutathione
- Reduced antioxidant capacity during critical brain development
- Increased vulnerability to oxidative damage

### Endocrine Disruption
- Potential effects on testosterone and other hormones
- Interference with normal neurodevelopmental processes
- Impact on sexual differentiation of the brain

### Immune System Effects
- Modulation of inflammatory responses
- Potential impact on cytokine signaling
- Effects on immune system development

## Current Scientific Consensus

### Key Challenges in Research

**Confounding by Indication**: Underlying illness (fever, infection) that prompts acetaminophen use may itself be the actual risk factor rather than the medication.

**Genetic and Familial Factors**: Studies that control for genetic confounding and familial factors show no significant associations.

**Study Design Limitations**:
- Recall bias in retrospective studies
- Difficulty establishing causation from correlation
- Inconsistent findings across different populations

## Clinical Recommendations

### Current Guidelines

FDA recommends that "clinicians should consider minimizing the use of acetaminophen during pregnancy for routine low-grade fevers" while balancing this with the fact that "acetaminophen is the safest over-the-counter alternative in pregnancy among all analgesics and antipyretics."

### For Healthcare Providers
- Weigh benefits vs. potential risks for individual patients
- Use lowest effective dose for shortest duration when treatment is necessary
- Consider that "most short-term fevers in pregnant women and young children do not require medication"

### For Pregnant Women
- Consult healthcare providers before medication use
- Understand that untreated maternal conditions for which acetaminophen is indicated—such as fever, migraines, and pain—can lead to significant maternal and fetal morbidity
- Avoid unnecessary medication use
- Consider non-pharmacological approaches when appropriate

## Ongoing Research

- NIH's $50 million Autism Data Science Initiative launched in May 2025 includes 7 awards focusing on autism etiology
- Large-scale prospective studies underway
- Investigation of genetic susceptibility factors
- Exploration of safe exposure thresholds
- Development of biomarkers for susceptibility

## Important Considerations

⚠️ **The relationship between acetaminophen and autism remains an area of active scientific debate. While the FDA has initiated label changes to inform the public, the agency emphasizes that a causal relationship has not been established. Current evidence does not warrant avoiding medically necessary use of acetaminophen during pregnancy.**

⚠️ **This information should not be used to make medical decisions without consulting healthcare professionals. Untreated fever and pain during pregnancy carry known risks.**
