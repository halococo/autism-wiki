# Ectopic Colonization by Oral Bacteria

## Hypothesis Summary

Certain oral bacteria may ectopically colonize the gut when colonization resistance is compromised, potentially producing neuroactive metabolites that could contribute to ASD pathogenesis.

## Proposed Pathways

### Pathway A: Direct Infant Exposure

Infant antibiotics → Direct disruption of gut colonization resistance → Oral bacteria occupy empty niches

### Pathway B: Altered Maternal Transfer

Maternal antibiotics (especially intrapartum) → Altered maternal microbiota → Reduced transfer of beneficial bacteria (*Bifidobacterium*, *Bacteroides*) at birth → Infant gut has unfilled ecological niches → Oral bacteria occupy those niches

### Common Downstream Pathway

Ectopic colonization by oral bacteria → Displacement of beneficial bacteria → Neuroactive metabolite production → Gut barrier dysfunction → Neuroinflammation → Potential contribution to ASD

## Candidate Bacteria

These genera have been identified in literature as potentially involved. Their inclusion does not imply confirmed causation:

| Genus | Notes |
|-------|-------|
| *Klebsiella* | Demonstrated causal role in IBD; induces TH1 response |
| *Clostridium* | Some species produce tetanus neurotoxin or propionic acid |
| *Streptococcus* | Increased in dental plaques of some ASD children |
| *Haemophilus* | Correlated with ASD symptom severity in one study |
| Others | Causative species may be unidentified |

## Supporting Evidence

| Finding | Source |
|---------|--------|
| *Klebsiella* strains from IBD patients cause inflammation via ectopic colonization | Atarashi et al., 2017 |
| Early antibiotic exposure associated with ASD risk | Eshraghi et al., 2018 |
| Intrapartum antibiotics reduce *Bifidobacterium* transfer | Dierikx et al., 2020 |
| Altered oral microbiota in ASD children | Qiao et al., 2018 |
| Oral-brain axis concept proposed | Kong et al., 2019 |

## Criticisms

Mitchell (2025) highlighted methodological limitations in gut-ASD research, including small sample sizes, inadequate controls, and inconsistent findings across studies.
