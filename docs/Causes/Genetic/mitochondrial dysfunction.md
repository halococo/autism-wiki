# Mitochondrial Dysfunction and Energy Metabolism

## Overview

Mitochondrial dysfunction is increasingly recognized as a central factor in ASD pathophysiology. The brain consumes approximately 20% of the body's total calories while accounting for only 2% of body weight—making it highly vulnerable to energy deficits.

## Evidence of Mitochondrial Dysfunction in ASD

### Electron Transport Chain (ETC) Abnormalities

Studies consistently report reduced activity of ETC complexes in individuals with ASD:

- Defects in complexes I, III, IV, and V documented
- Complex I is the most consistently affected
- Reduced ATP production observed in cerebellum and striatum

### Energy Metabolism Biomarkers

A systematic review of 204 studies found significant elevations in key metabolic markers:

| Biomarker | Abnormal Prevalence in ASD |
|-----------|---------------------------|
| Lactate | 17% |
| Pyruvate | 41% |
| Alanine | 15% |
| Creatine kinase | 9% |

Effect sizes were moderate to large (Cohen's d ≥ 0.6) for pyruvate, lactate-to-pyruvate ratio, ATP, and creatine kinase.

### Brain-Specific Findings

- Reduced N-acetylaspartate (NAA) in multiple brain regions
- Abnormal phosphocreatine and creatine levels in thalamus
- Elevated brain lactate on MRS imaging

### Prevalence

A large population-based study estimated mitochondrial disease prevalence in ASD at **7.2%**.

## Behavioral Manifestations

### Gaze Avoidance as Energy Conservation

Visual processing consumes up to **40% of cerebral energy**. A hypothesis proposes that gaze avoidance may function as an unconscious energy conservation strategy:

1. Impaired bioenergetic processing reduces available ATP
2. Visual processing (especially faces) demands substantial energy
3. The brain unconsciously prioritizes energy allocation
4. High-cost visual inputs are reduced → manifests as gaze avoidance

This reframes gaze avoidance from "social deficit" to "adaptive energy management."

### Supporting Evidence

- Gaze aversion increases with cognitive load in ASD
- Mitochondrial dysfunction markers correlate with autism severity
- Visual processing abnormalities consistently reported in ASD

## Therapeutic Implications

Metabolic support interventions may help:

- Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10)
- L-carnitine
- B vitamins
- Alpha-lipoic acid
