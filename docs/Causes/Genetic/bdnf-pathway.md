# BDNF/TrkB Pathway

*Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor and its receptor system*

## Overview

Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) is a crucial protein that supports the survival, growth, and differentiation of neurons. It acts through its primary receptor, TrkB (encoded by the NTRK2 gene), playing a vital role in brain development and synaptic plasticity.

## Connection to Autism

Research has identified several ways in which BDNF pathway dysfunction may contribute to autism:

- **Reduced BDNF levels** observed in some individuals with autism
- **Genetic variants** in NTRK2 (TrkB receptor gene) associated with ASD
- **Impaired synaptic plasticity** affecting learning and social behavior
- **Altered brain development** during critical periods

## Key Research Findings

Studies have shown:
- Polymorphisms in BDNF and NTRK2 genes linked to autism risk
- Abnormal BDNF expression patterns in postmortem autism brain tissue
- Animal models with BDNF/TrkB disruption showing autism-like behaviors

## Clinical Implications

Understanding this pathway may lead to:
- Biomarker development for early diagnosis
- Targeted therapeutic interventions
- Personalized treatment approaches
